The way I designed it is not working the way it needs to.

The design is a bit confusing.

Too many jobs are being performed in the same places.

Need to separate jobs completely.


1.
genSimsStudied should be fully initialized before 
processing studied repetition dates.

2.
Next_Date should calculate from Simulated_Date of repetition.

3.
At end of current repetitions processing:

IF index < list_being_simulated.Count && list[index].topic_num == list[index + 1].topic_num

  THEN: Next repetition's Simulated_Date should immediately be initialized to
        the value of 





/*************BEFORE CLEARING genSimsStudied: START************/

--->Calculate values of maximum repeats, and y at maximum repeats
--->Done

/*************AFTER CLEARING genSimsStudied: END************/


/*********projectedVarsList: START***************************/

Fill projected vars with necessary values

do the same thing to get new topics into genSimsAll
/*********projectedVarsList: START***************************/


/*********genSimsAll START***********************************/

during study, check if repetition == 1

IF repetition is == 1; THEN
  make sure it gets necessary initial values for the repetition == 1

/*********genSimsAll END***********************************/
  

/*********Workout what to fix below after I fix everything from above*********/
4. - genSimsAll date processing fix
Add Repetition function should only be called if:

genSimsAll just needs to update the values at the current 
index location of the current simulated study. 

1. Next_Date should be set inside Simulated_Date, and 
   inside Next_Date.

2. All other values should be set to initialize it's next 
   study date.

3. IF projectedVars.Count == ZERO
   THEN last study day = genSimsAll[some index].Next_Date
  1. studying from genSimsAll

  2.  




/*************BEFORE CLEARING genSimsAll: START************/



// Don't clear genSimsAll until final study date has been found.
// genSimsAll's elements can be updated in-place during study simulation.
// Add new studies from projectedVars, at a quantity == y





/*************AFTER CLEARING genSimsAll: END************/
