  What is predictVars.Gen_Projected_Index used for again?

4.
  Is genSimsAll getting actual dates from file, or simulated dates?
  It needs actual dates, the first date it displays to study is the day 
  after the actual date, but it is being studied on the correct study date.

  Also, that same element's date is not updating. Look in the debug results.



5.
  Data from studiedSimList:
  1.
  Make sure studiedSimList gets all needed values from TopicList before
  first time giving them to genAllSims.

  2.
  Make sure genSimsAll gets all of those values from studiedSimList.




  Data Usage during Simulation of Study functions:

  1.
  Make sure each value is calulated that previous study sessions have values
  for.

  2.
  Do not use values for new studies that cause program to crash during study
  simulation.


6.
  Make sure simulation of past studies calculates all values such as:

    Sim_Repetition
