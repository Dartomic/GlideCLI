# Preparing a course

The table of contents in text books, normally have chapters, and sections that the chapters are divided into. These sections are the "Sub-Sections" that GlideCLI asks for the number of, for every chapter. When you look through the sub-sections of every chapter, most of these are normally also further divided into smaller segments. These segments will often have a title in bold print. I call these sections of the Sub-Sections "Topics." These topics are the units that contain the information that you need to learn.

Sub-Sections of chapters, are usually numbered. If chapter 1 has 3 sub-sections, then the third sub-section is normally labeled "1.3" inside of a text book. Topics are normally not numbered within a text book. So, you need to number each topic yourself. I either write the number in the textbook, next to the topic heading, or, if it is an ebook, I write the number in a word processor, with the label of the topic next to the number. Doing this makes everything easier. If the third sub-section of the first chapter is numbered 1.3, then the second topic, of section 1.3, is section 2. So, I would write 1.3.2, and the third topic of 1.3, would be 1.3.3, and so on.


When a topic does not have math problems, then you need to write the questions down, and you need to write the answer down for every question. It would help to number the questions and answers, starting with "1", for every topic. If section 1.3.2 has 16 problems, or questions, or a mix of both, then number each from 1 to 16. If section 1.3.3 has 4 problems, or questions, or a mix of both, then number each from 1 to 4.

When a topic does have math problems, then most of the time, you will only need to write down how many problems that topic has. Make sure you only count the problems that have answers. A lot of textbooks have problems with no answers too, so do not count those.

The number of questions, and/or problems, need to be written down for every topic.

Every math problem can either be numbered in the textbook, or the problem can be written down, and the answer written down. You can use flash cards, or a notebook, if you need to write it down outside of the book. I find a notebook easier to keep everything together, so I write the question next to it's number, and write the answer underneath the question. When I study, I hide the answer until I have responded with an answer in my head, or on paper. There is no reason to shuffle the flash cards, that is why I don't mind using a notebook. That way it all stays together, and specific topics are easy to find.

The program needs to know how many questions and/or problems exist for every topic. 

Sometimes a "Sub-Section" may not be further sub-divided into topics within a textbook, because there is not enough information for it to need to be sub-divided into topics. In this case, the sub-section has only one topic--- itself. If you need to learn that topic, then treat it the same as the other topics, and number it like one.

Sometimes an entire chapter is stuff that is not needed to be learned. So, when the program asks for the number of "Sub-Sections" for that chapter, just put 0, (as in the number zero).

Once I have all the numbering of topics, and have the questions and/or problems numbered, I organize that information in a word processor, so that I have that information ready to enter into GlideCLI while it asks me for that information.

Here is how it should look before you create the course in GlideCLI: https://github.com/Dartomic/GlideCLI/blob/master/course%20set%20up.odt


# Studying

Just study the topics that GlideCLI prompts you to study, one at a time. 

Look at every question and/or problem one-by-one. If it's a new topic for you, then read the material pertaining to that topic so can answer the questions and/or problems. 

After you think of the answer, or write the answer down, then compare your answer to the actual answer under the question, or in the book. 

If it is a new topic for you, and if your answer is incorrect, write an 'X' by the question or problem. Do this for every question/problem, one-by-one, if you have not yet studied that topic. Once that topic is out of questions, then add the number of X's you wrote by questions/problems within the topic. Subtract that sum from the total number of questions and/or problems that exist for that topic. The result is the number of correct answers you have. Make sure that result is less than, or equal to, the number of problems that exist for that topic. GlideCLI will ask for the number of problems and/or answers that you got correct, if it is the first time you are studying the particular topic. It will not ask for this number again. The number of correct problems and/or questions is used to calculate the difficulty of the topic, to calculate the spacing of the dates for that topic to be studied.

If it is not a new topic for you, then study the topic the same way. But you do not need to mark an 'X' by the incorrectly answered problems/questions, because GlideCLI only needs that information the first time that topic is studied.

# That's it!

I may make a video tutorial later, on how to set GlideCLI up, in case these instructions confuse anyone. It's a lot easier to set up than the other programs I looked at. It only took me a day to set up my first course. Plus, GlideCLI is more precise, which is something I guess I need to demonstrate in a video as well.
